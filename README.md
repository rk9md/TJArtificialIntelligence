All the code I wrote in my high school Artificial Intelligence class

The code that has been added to the repository is all the code I had written for my 11th grade Artificial Intelligence class. Assignments included creating a bot to play othello, an algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles, visually representing solving a travelling salesmen problem, and more! Feel free to take a look at the code.

As of now, it is not commented well at all and I will be working on creating README's and commenting the code so that it is easier to understand over the next few weeks.
