# TicTacToe
The two files in here were my solutions to the tic tac toe unit we did.
ttt.py - A script that takes in a board and return the possible moves categorized into good, tie, bad moves.
tttgame.py - A script that simulates a human vs computer game of tic tac toe. The computer's AI plays the best move generated by the algorithm in ttt.py.
